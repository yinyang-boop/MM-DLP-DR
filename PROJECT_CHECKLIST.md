# Project Checklist — DDLS 2025 Final Project

This checklist helps ensure all required files and deliverables are prepared before submission.

---

## 1. Static files (prepare & upload manually)

- [ ] **README.md**  
  - Overview of project, Colab badge, usage instructions, data notes, performance table.

- [ ] **LICENSE**  
  - MIT License file.

- [ ] **.gitignore**  
  - Ignore temp files, checkpoints, raw data, models, results.

- [ ] **requirements.txt**  
  - Pinned dependencies (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, rdkit, etc.).

- [ ] **notebooks/**  
  - `01_phase1_eda.ipynb`  
  - `02_phase2_training.ipynb`  
  - `03_phase3_tools_demo.ipynb`

- [ ] **src/** (optional but recommended)  
  - `data_io.py` (load splits, save data)  
  - `models.py` (baseline training functions)  
  - `tools.py` (inference, evaluation helpers)

- [ ] **scripts/** (optional)  
  - `download_chembl.py`  
  - `download_gdsc.py`  
  - `preprocess_drugbank.py`

---

## 2. Dynamic files (generated by running notebooks in Colab)

- [ ] **results/**  
  - `figures/` (EDA plots, split distributions, evaluation curves)  
  - `metrics/` (JSON/CSV with ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, summary tables)  
  - `predictions/` (optional: model outputs)

- [ ] **models/**  
  - Trained model artifacts (e.g., `rf_baseline.pkl`)  
  - Upload large files to GitHub Releases or Zenodo instead of repo.

- [ ] **data/processed/**  
  - Train/val/test splits for ChEMBL, DrugBank, GDSC  
  - ⚠️ Do not commit large data files; instead provide scripts or instructions.

## 3. FAIR & Open Science requirements

- [ ] Public GitHub repository created  
- [ ] Add topic: `ddls-course-2025`  
- [ ] README includes reproducibility instructions  
- [ ] License file present (MIT)  
- [ ] Code documented with comments/docstrings  
- [ ] Data download scripts or instructions provided  
- [ ] Trained weights uploaded to GitHub Releases or Zenodo  
- [ ] Report or summary uploaded (optional: Zenodo DOI)

---

## 4. Final sanity check

- [ ] All notebooks run end-to-end without errors  
- [ ] Figures and metrics generated in `results/`  
- [ ] Summary table (`phase1_summary.csv`) present  
- [ ] Checklist reviewed and all boxes ticked
